# Platformer
Simple platfomer make in C++ and SFML. Not even sure how it will looks like.
# Project Status
So, the PhysicEngine is almost done (I think :) ). That's really cool engine because it can detect 8 sides of collision (I have not seen that on enthernet) with cool patern.
To-Do is now TextureManager.
