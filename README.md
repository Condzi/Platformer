2. TextureManager is done, I add some referencion counter so texture will delete if no one is using it. To-Do are now Animations.
1. So, the PhysicEngine is almost done (I think :) ). That's really cool engine because it can detect 8 sides of collision (I have not seen that on enthernet) with cool patern.
To-Do is now TextureManager.
